The solution involved identifying a dependency conflict.  The package 'react-native-unimodules' was causing the problem, likely due to version incompatibility with other dependencies. Updating it to the latest version resolved the issue. Here is an example of how the package.json file may be updated to show the resolution:

```json
{
  // ... other dependencies
  "react-native-unimodules": "^0.16.0"
}
```

After updating the package, running `expo install` and subsequently `expo prebuild` will address the issue.   Building and deploying the app after this modification will resolve the error.
