# Expo CLI Build Failure: Vague Error Message and Deployment Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Expo CLI to build a React Native application. The build process unexpectedly halts with a generic error message, preventing successful deployment to simulators and emulators.  The problem seems to stem from an incompatibility or conflict within the project's dependencies or configurations, but pinpointing the exact root cause is challenging.  This repository includes the problematic code (`bug.js`) and a proposed solution (`bugSolution.js`).

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
4. Attempt to build the app using Expo CLI (e.g., `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`).

You should observe the build process halting with an unclear error.

## Solution

The proposed solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the problem by [insert a brief description of the solution. For example:  removing conflicting dependencies or updating a particular package].  This resolves the vague error message and enables successful app deployment.

## Additional Notes

This bug highlights the importance of carefully managing dependencies in React Native projects.  Vague error messages can be particularly challenging to debug, and a systematic approach to troubleshooting is essential.
